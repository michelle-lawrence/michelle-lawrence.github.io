title: Week of December 6
---
Well, the time has finally come, dear readers, and the feeling is bittersweet. Our final week of Object-Oriented Programming has come and gone. Our final exam covered a lot less than I had anticipated, but its style and form were much like the midterm.

At this time I suppose it’s appropriate to look back on the semester and summarize my experience.  When I first signed up for this course, I was still fresh from the epic trials that are the Operating Systems and Algorithms courses that seem to define our major.  I had heard that Object-Oriented Programming was challenging, but that Professor Downing was a must-have on the list of credentials, so despite my manifold hesitations I signed up. 

Though the course took quite a bit of attention and was indeed intellectually challenging, it has become one of the most influential courses I’ve taken in my college career. In stark contrast to OS and Algorithms, I was tasked with solving interesting and common problems without ever feeling overwhelmed. Each project was manageable and effectively communicated the information we were supposed to glean from it. The lectures, too, even beyond Downing’s entertaining eccentricities, were captivating and went into a level of detail regarding the C++ language that was fascinating without being too academic (i.e. still applicable and industry-focused). 

I know it may sound like I’m just saying all this to get a good grade or butter up the professor or what have you, but I legitimately got so much out of this course. I know some students might seem hesitant because they want an easy A or they’re burned out from the weed-out courses, but this course is absolutely worth the focus and effort. 

Tip of the Week: A more personal tip this final week, readers. Don’t be afraid to try new things and challenge yourself. I thought I wasn’t smart enough or “computer science-y” enough to do well in this course, and it has ended up being one of the most interesting and engaging classes I’ve taken – one of my favorites. Don’t hesitate to take those chances, especially for your education. You’ll be surprised what you might learn about yourself.
